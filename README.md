# Gallery of Visuals (Icons, Illustration, ...)

```bash
n(ico) + icon = nicon
```

## Introduction

This repository contains visuals:
  * simple (icons, ...)
  * composite (composed of simple visual) such as illustration
  * and photos



That are organized in a [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) and published on the [web](https://gerardnico.com/doc/gallery/)
where they can be searched.

The result can be seen at [https://gerardnico.com/doc/gallery/](https://gerardnico.com/doc/gallery/)


## Usage

To develop your own gallery, you need to (only once):

  * Copy this repo
  * Delete the content of the [gallery folder](./gallery/)
  * Delete the content of the [stories folder](./stories/)

then you can develop your gallery:

  * Add your images in the [gallery folder](./gallery/).
  * [Optional] Add a markdown file with the same name than your image for documentation
  * Generate the StoryBook stories in the [stories folder](./stories/)

```bash
yarn generate
```

  * Start storybook to verify

```bash
yarn start
```

  * Build. The build:
     * takes the Gallery Url given in the [.env.production](.env.production) file
     * generate the story with it
     * generate the static storybook
     * re-generate the stories with no Gallery Url as set in the [.env](.env) file

```bash
yarn build
```

  * Transfer the [storybook-static directory](./storybook-static) on your web server. Example: [https://gerardnico.com/doc/gallery/](https://gerardnico.com/doc/gallery/)

## Rules

  * You can add `README.md` files in the [gallery](./gallery/)
  * You can add a markdown documentation file next to the image with the same name. ie if the image is `red.png`, the markdown should be named `red.md`.
  * Every directory in the [gallery](./gallery/) with a file will create a [story](./stories/)
